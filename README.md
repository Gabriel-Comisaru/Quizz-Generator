# Quizz-Generator

Users of this program will authenticate themselves within the application for any system call (for simplicity), except for the user creation call. Authenticated users in the system will be able to create questions (with a single correct answer, or with multiple correct answers), create questionnaires based on previously added questions, and respond to other users' questionnaires, only once.
